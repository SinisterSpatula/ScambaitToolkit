# TinyCore Linux - Wireshark

## Download the ova for vmware only 75 Mb to have a very small virtual appliance for monitoring traffic on your network.  I installed open-vm-tools, Xorg gui, and set a larger screen resolution.  Tinycore version 7.2 and wireshark version 2.2.1.
Tested with ESXI 7.0 Update 2 and VMware workstation 16 pro.
